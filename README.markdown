# PetaPoco with support for Composite Keys #

<h2 class="tagline">A tiny ORM-ish thing for your POCOs (that supports composite primary keys!)</h2>

PetaPoco with composite primary keys is forked from Brad Robinson of Topten Software's PetaPoco v5, with added 
support for Composite Primary keys.

PetaPoco v5 (from which this is forked) is currently not deployed to NuGet because it 
'shouldn't be considered production quality' according to Brad. This is a quick-and-dirty change (no tests) to support
composite primary keys - so expect it to be even less 'production quality'!
